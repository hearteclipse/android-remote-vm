## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/android-remote-vm.git
cd android-remote-vm

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/android-remote-vm.git

# Install dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest
```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Write docstrings for functions/classes
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable names

```python
# Good
def create_device(user_id: int, device_name: str) -> Device:
    """
    Create a new virtual Android device.
    
    Args:
        user_id: ID of the user creating the device
        device_name: Name for the new device
        
    Returns:
        Device: The created device object
    """
    pass

# Bad
def cd(u, n):
    pass
```

### JavaScript (Frontend)

- Use ES6+ features
- Use const/let instead of var
- Use async/await instead of callbacks
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs

```
Add WebRTC reconnection logic

## Testing

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/
```

### Integration Tests

# Run tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add docstrings to all functions/classes
- Update API documentation
- Include code examples

## Project Structure Guidelines

```
